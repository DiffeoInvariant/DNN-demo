This directory is for exploratory image/video analysis. Currently, I'm trying to automatically detect the top and bottom of the beer foam. I recommend running the commented lines at the top of driver.py first to unpack the video into frames, create a directory for them, and move them to that directory (done this way instead of writing to the directory so you can decide if you want to keep them in the code directory for convenience).

If you have better video/image data to be working with for this, let me know and I'll redirect my efforts there.
